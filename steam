First enable multilib
uncomment [multilib] and Include=/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist 

install the libs for your graphic card in 32bits
pacman -S xf86-video-ati lib32-mesa-libgl

and the 32x sound
pacman -S lib32-alsa-plugins

the arial font
pacman -S ttf-liberation

then steam
pacman -S steam

Lastly you need to erase the libs that come with steam, because you already have them installed on a newer versions
find ~/.steam/root/ \( -name "libgcc_s.so*" -o -name "libstdc++.so*" -o -name "libxcb.so*" \) -print -delete
